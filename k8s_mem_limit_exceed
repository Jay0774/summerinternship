# A Container can exceed its memory request if the Node has memory available.
# But a Container is not allowed to use more than its memory limit.
# If a Container allocates more memory than its limit, the Container becomes a candidate for termination.
# If the Container continues to consume memory beyond its limit, the Container is terminated.
# If a terminated Container can be restarted, the kubelet restarts it, as with any other type of runtime failure.

# create the pod file as exceed.yml:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: memory-demo-2
  namespace: mem-example
spec:
  containers:
  - name: memory-demo-2-ctr
    image: polinux/stress
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "50Mi"
      limits:
        memory: "100Mi"
    command: ["stress"]
    args: ["--vm", "1", "--vm-bytes", "250M", "--vm-hang", "1"]
    
# create the resource as:

kubectl create -f exceed.yml

# to ckeck the status of presource use command:

kubectl get pods

# if its not running the see inside the pod as:

kubectl get pod <pod_name> --output=yaml
