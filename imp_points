There are 5 ways by which we can create pods:

1. using yaml
2. using json
3. using api
4. using run option of kubectl
5. using program

There are 4 types of services:

1. clusterip
2. nodeport                     # access outside kube cluster
3. loadbalancer                 # access outside kube cluster
4. External name

Both service ip and pod ip is not rechable.

User can access master ip (not followed) or worker ip.
